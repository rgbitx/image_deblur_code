This package contains the implementation of the blind deconvolution
algorithm presented in the paper:

"Blind Deconvolution using a Normalized Sparsity Measure", Dilip
Krishnan, Terence Tay and Rob Fergus.

Use of this code is free for research purposes only.

This package contains a set of Matlab files that have been tested on
Matlab 7.11 (R2011b) on Red Hat Linux. A few test images have also
been provided.

The top-level function that to be run is test_blind_deconv.m; here one
may specify the file name that is to be read in. The code is
documented and should be self-explanatory. 

To report any bugs, please email: Dilip Krishnan, dilip@cs.nyu.edu
